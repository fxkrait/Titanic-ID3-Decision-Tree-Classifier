a) 
   Mean is: 29.962962962962962
   Median is: 25
b)
   Mode is: 25
   We can see that this data is tri-modal, as there are 3 distinct 'humps' on a super-imposed outline of the edges of the histogram

c)
  Max is: 70
  Max is: 13
  MidRange is: 5.384615384615385

  Q1 is: 20.5
  Q3 is: 35.0
e)
  Min is: 13
  Q1 is: 20.5
  Median is: 25.0
  Q3 is: 35.0

- A quantile-quantile plot (QQ-Plot), is also called a Normal Quantile Plot.
    - The Normal Quantile Plot is created by comparing the quantiles of a Normal distribution with the quantiles of the data distribution.
    - It can tell you if your data is **normally distributed** (and thus, if will show if it's skewed, and in which direction).
- A Quantile plot (Q-Plot)
    - This is just a graph of all of the quantiles of your data points.
